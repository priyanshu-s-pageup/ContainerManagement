Ⓜ️ *There are 8 official lifecycle hooks in Angular 19:*

✅ 1. ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges)

Called when: Any data-bound input property changes. 📌

Applies to: Components and directives with @Input() properties. 📌

Runs: Before ngOnInit() and whenever an @Input changes. 📌

✅ 2. ngOnInit()

Called when: The component is initialized. 📌

Runs: Once after the first ngOnChanges() (if any). 📌

Typical use: Initialization logic (e.g., fetching data). 📌

✅ 3. ngDoCheck()

Called when: Angular runs its change detection. 📌

Runs: Frequently—on every change detection cycle. 📌

Use case: Custom change detection (advanced scenarios). 📌

✅ 4. ngAfterContentInit()

Called when: Angular projects external content into the component. 📌

Applies to: Components with <ng-content>. 📌

Runs: Once after content is projected. 📌

✅ 5. ngAfterContentChecked()

Called when: Angular checks the content projected into the component. 📌

Runs: After every ngDoCheck(). 📌

✅ 6. ngAfterViewInit()

Called when: Component’s view and child views are fully initialized. 📌

Applies to: Components using @ViewChild, @ViewChildren. 📌

Typical use: DOM or component child manipulation. 📌

✅ 7. ngAfterViewChecked()

Called when: Angular checks the component’s view and child views. 📌

Runs: After every ngAfterViewInit() and subsequent change detection cycles. 📌

✅ 8. ngOnDestroy()

Called when: The component or directive is about to be destroyed. 📌

Typical use: Clean-up tasks like unsubscribing from Observables, stopping timers, etc. 📌
